# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
 My motivation for this project was to be able to understand the different beginning elements that are needed to begin coding. I built this project so that I could practice using HTML, CSS, and JAVA SCRPIT. I have never used any of this before, so practicing was dire for my success. I followed the directions and created this project to be able to undersand them all better. The problem that it solved was my understnading of everything. It brought me from knowing nothing, to being able to follow directions to build a interactive website. I learned how to connect filed on github through my terminal, how to merge different branches, how to use CSS to edit the style of my webpage, how to use JAVA SCRIPT to make my webpage interactive, and I learned how to make the contents of the webpage with HTML.
